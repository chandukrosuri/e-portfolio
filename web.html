            The Transformers-themed quiz was a passion project inspired by my
            love for the Transformers franchise, spanning movies, TV shows, and
            comics. The goal was to create a quiz that allowed fans to immerse
            themselves in Cybertron's world while testing their knowledge about
            Autobots and Decepticons. I started by crafting questions that
            balanced difficulty, keeping them engaging yet accessible to both
            seasoned fans and casual users. Each question reflects iconic
            moments, characters, or battles central to the Transformers saga,
            drawing players into the rich lore of the series. To achieve this, I
            used JavaScript to handle dynamic interactions and CSS to style the
            interface, giving it a futuristic look that complemented the theme.
            Debugging and refining the drag-and-drop feature was a significant
            challenge. I had to ensure seamless functionality across devices,
            especially mobile, which required rigorous testing. Through this
            process, I developed a deeper understanding of user interface design
            and interactive web elements.

            The drag-and-drop country trivia quiz was designed to combine
            education with interactivity. This project aimed to make learning
            geography enjoyable and engaging by allowing users to categorize
            countries based on unique trivia. Implementing the drag-and-drop
            feature required exploring HTML5 APIs to create a smooth and
            intuitive interface. I also focused on responsive design to ensure
            the quiz performed well on devices of various screen sizes. A
            critical challenge was ensuring the trivia questions were both
            educational and entertaining, which involved researching fascinating
            facts about countries. To enhance the visual appeal, I incorporated
            vibrant colors, flags, and geographic imagery, adding a playful
            touch to the design. This project strengthened my skills in creating
            educational content and taught me the importance of balancing
            functionality with aesthetic appeal.

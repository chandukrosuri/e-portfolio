          <p class="project-description">
            My recreation of the Attack on Titan cover was inspired by the
            series’ deep themes of freedom, sacrifice, and human resilience. The
            original story's exploration of these concepts motivated me to
            reflect this complexity in the design. Using Photoshop, I worked on
            blending colors and textures to create a dramatic and immersive
            look. One of the challenges was aligning the cover's visual elements
            with the emotional intensity of the series. The characters,
            especially Eren and Mikasa, represent the conflict between
            individuality and societal expectations, which I aimed to capture
            using symbolic imagery. Through this project, I developed a deeper
            understanding of design principles, such as contrast, symmetry, and
            the use of gradients to convey mood.

            As a car enthusiast, I wanted my logo to represent the passion and
            thrill of automotive design. Creating a sleek and dynamic look, I
            incorporated neon tones to evoke motion and energy. One challenge
            was finding the right font and layout to balance aesthetics with
            readability. I used Adobe Illustrator to experiment with glitch
            effects and vibrant colors, ensuring the design would stand out.
            This project taught me how small details, like alignment and
            spacing, can significantly impact the overall appeal of a logo. It
            also deepened my appreciation for modern graphic design techniques,
            which I look forward to exploring further.

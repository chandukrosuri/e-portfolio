            I tried to capture the story's in-depth examination of life,
            freedom, and human nature when I recreated the cover for Attack on
            Titan. The story revolves around humanity's battle to survive in the
            face of Titans' overwhelming threat, which represents life's
            unavoidable difficulties. Mikasa's devotion, Levi's sense of
            obligation, and Eren's quest for independence all emphasize the
            conflict between individual aspirations and the sacrifices required
            by life. Reflecting on themes of sacrifice, morality, and
            resilience, the story implies that real freedom might not be found
            in tearing down physical barriers but rather in realizing one's
            place in an imperfect world.

            As a car enthusiast, I designed a logo that captures my love for
            automobiles and the excitement of car modification, blending both
            style and innovation. The design incorporates the sleek curve of a
            car's tail light, using smooth lines and vibrant neon tones to
            convey motion and energy. I aligned key letters in a staggered
            arrangement to reflect the dynamic nature of car culture, and added
            a glitch effect for a modern, edgy touch. This logo embodies the
            boldness of car design, merging aesthetic appeal with the thrill of
            automotive modification.

            I created this 15-second animated video using Adobe Animate to
            visually explain the process of photosynthesis in an engaging and
            easy-to-understand way. The animation illustrates key stages,
            starting with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll, the intake
            of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the release of oxygen as
            a byproduct. I used smooth motion tweens and carefully labeled
            visuals to ensure each concept was clearly presented, while
            transitions between scenes provided a seamless flow.
            <br /><br/>
            To make the animation visually appealing, I designed a subtle yellow
            gradient background to evoke warmth and light, complementing the
            theme of sunlight in photosynthesis. I added fade-in and fade-out
            effects for a polished look and incorporated text overlays, such as
            "Sunlight Absorbed" and "Oxygen Released," to emphasize important
            steps in the process. This combination of visuals and text ensured
            the scientific concepts were both informative and visually engaging.
            <br /><br/>
            Creating this project presented its own set of challenges. I spent
            time learning the various features of Adobe Animate, including how
            to manage registration points for smooth motion and maintain
            accuracy in depicting biological processes. Despite these hurdles,
            the experience was incredibly rewarding. The final video effectively
            communicates the complex process of photosynthesis in a concise
            format.
